    <h1><b>Sorting</b></h1>
    <p>A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most-used orders are
      numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other
      algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists; it is also
      often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.

    <h1><b>Bubble sort</b></h1>
    <p>Bubble sort has many of the same properties as insertion sort, but has slightly higher overhead. In the case
      of nearly sorted data, bubble sort takes O(n) time, but requires at least 2 passes through the data (whereas
      insertion sort requires something more like 1 pass).

    <h1><b>Insertion sort</b></h1>
    <p>Although it is one of the elementary sorting algorithms with O(n2) worst-case time, insertion sort is the
      algorithm of choice either when the data is nearly sorted (because it is adaptive) or when the problem size
      is small (because it has low overhead). For these reasons, and because it is also stable, insertion sort is
      often used as the recursive base case (when the problem size is small) for higher overhead
      divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms, such as merge sort or quick sort

    <p>From the comparions presented here, one might conclude that selection sort should never be used. It does not
      adapt to the data in any way (notice that the four animations above run in lock step), so its runtime is
      always quadratic. However, selection sort has the property of minimizing the number of swaps. In
      applications where the cost of swapping items is high, selection sort very well may be the algorithm of
      choice.

    <h1><b>Shell sort</b></h1>
    <p>The worse-case time complexity of shell sort depends on the increment sequence. For the increments 1 4 13 40
      121…, which is what is used here, the time complexity is O(n3/2). For other increments, time complexity is
      known to be O(n4/3) and even O(n·lg2(n)). Neither tight upper bounds on time complexity nor the best
      increment sequence are known. Because shell sort is based on insertion sort, shell sort inherits insertion
      sort’s adaptive properties. The adapation is not as dramatic because shell sort requires one pass through
      the data for each increment, but it is significant. For the increment sequence shown above, there are
      log3(n) increments, so the time complexity for nearly sorted data is O(n·log3(n)). Because of its low
      overhead, relatively simple implementation, adaptive properties, and sub-quadratic time complexity, shell
      sort may be a viable alternative to the O(n·lg(n)) sorting algorithms for some applications when the data to
      be sorted is not very large.

    <h1><b>Heap sort</b></h1>
    <p>Heap sort is simple to implement, performs an O(n·lg(n)) in-place sort, but is not stable. The first loop,
      the Θ(n) “heapify” phase, puts the array into heap order. The second loop, the O(n·lg(n)) “sortdown” phase,
      repeatedly extracts the maximum and restores heap order. The sink function is written recursively for
      clarity. Thus, as shown, the code requires Θ(lg(n)) space for the recursive call stack. However, the tail
      recursion in sink() is easily converted to iteration, which yields the O(1) space bound. Both phases are
      slightly adaptive, though not in any particularly useful manner. In the nearly sorted case, the heapify
      phase destroys the original order. In the reversed case, the heapify phase is as fast as possible since the
      array starts in heap order, but then the sortdown phase is typical. In the few unique keys case, there is
      some speedup but not as much as in shell sort or 3-way quicksort.

    <h1><b>Merge sort</b></h1>
    <p>Merge sort is very predictable. It makes between 0.5lg(n) and lg(n) comparisons per element, and between
      lg(n) and 1.5lg(n) swaps per element. The minima are achieved for already sorted data; the maxima are
      achieved, on average, for random data. If using Θ(n) extra space is of no concern, then merge sort is an
      excellent choice: It is simple to implement, and it is the only stable O(n·lg(n)) sorting algorithm. Note
      that when sorting linked lists, merge sort requires only Θ(lg(n)) extra space (for recursion). Merge sort is
      the algorithm of choice for a variety of situations: when stability is required, when sorting linked lists,
      and when random access is much more expensive than sequential access (for example, external sorting on
      tape). There do exist linear time in-place merge algorithms for the last step of the algorithm, but they are
      both expensive and complex. The complexity is justified for applications such as external sorting when Θ(n)
      extra space is not available.

    <h1><b>Quick sort</b></h1>
    <p>When carefully implemented, quick sort is robust and has low overhead. When a stable sort is not needed,
      quick sort is an excellent general-purpose sort – although the 3-way partitioning version should always be
      used instead. The 2-way partitioning code shown above is written for clarity rather than optimal
      performance; it exhibits poor locality, and, critically, exhibits O(n2) time when there are few unique keys.
      A more efficient and robust 2-way partitioning method is given in Quicksort is Optimal by Robert Sedgewick
      and Jon Bentley. The robust partitioning produces balanced recursion when there are many values equal to the
      pivot, yielding probabilistic guarantees of O(n·lg(n)) time and O(lg(n)) space for all inputs. With both
      sub-sorts performed recursively, quick sort requires O(n) extra space for the recursion stack in the worst
      case when recursion is not balanced. This is exceedingly unlikely to occur, but it can be avoided by sorting
      the smaller sub-array recursively first; the second sub-array sort is a tail recursive call, which may be
      done with iteration instead. With this optimization, the algorithm uses O(lg(n)) extra space in the worst
      case.

      algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to

      and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.

    <p>In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt string searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for
      occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch
      occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus
      bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.
